Customization
Chart Dimensions
The chart has a fixed height of 400px and a width of 100%, which can be adjusted as needed.
Chart Colors
The chart supports a custom color palette defined in the colors array. Modify this array to change the color scheme of the lines.
Animation
The lines have an animated effect enabled by default, with the motionConfig set to "default". You can customize the animation settings as needed.
Point Configuration
You can customize the size and border of the points on the line with pointSize, pointBorderWidth, and pointBorderColor properties.
Notes
Ensure that the data provided matches the expected structure to avoid rendering issues.
The chart's x-axis uses a point scale, making it suitable for categorical data. Adjust the scale type if necessary for your data.
